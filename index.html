            <p>I was born at an early age. My parents don't know where I was conceived; thus I am considered inconceivable. I grew up in Hong Kong, a wonderful cultural melting pot that exposed me to different races, ethnicities and gave me an appreciation for the diversity of the human experience.</p>
            <p>I came to America for college, where I majored in Biology. Despite my intellectual love for the sciences, I ultimately realized I wanted a professional career more in line with my greatest passions: sports and technology. After moving to Chicago for a job at Northwestern University, I achieved a Master's in Sports Administration.</p>
            <p>As the next step in my plan for world domination, I'm enrolled in this Coding Boot Camp, honing my technical abilities and learning skills that will differentiate me in the sports field.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I love to watch basketball, work on my blog about the NBA, hang out with my dog (Jordan) and cat (Luna), watch TV/movies, and listen to music. Another one of my greatest passions is traveling the globe with my lovely wife. We love exploring new locales, tasting exotic cuisines and immersing ourselves in new cultures. My favorite adventure to date was hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu.</p>
            <p>How would I describe myself?</p>
